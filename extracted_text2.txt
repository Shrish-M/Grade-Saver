Here is the extracted text from the image:

Assumptions:
File has at least 50 characters
ERR_ON_OPEN is defined as an integer (-1)
OK is defined as an integer (0)
int get_characters (char * file_name)
	{
		char buffer[51];
		FILE * fp = fopen (file_name, "r");
		if (fp == NULL)
			return ERR_ON_OPEN;
		fscanf(fp, "%50s", &buffer[0]);
		for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++)
			if (buffer[i] != 0)
				print(buffer[i]);
			else return i;
}
Turn over for additional space...

The annotation in the image reads:
fscanf() function called incorrectly
Need to pass in the array itself
