ERR

Assumptions:
File has at least 50 characters
ERR-ON-OPEN is defined as an integer (-1)
OK is defined as an integer (0)

int get_characters (char* file_name)
{
    char buffer[51];
    FILE * fp = fopen (file-name, "r");
    if (fp == NULL)
        return ERR-ON-OPEN;

    fscanf (fp, "%50c", &buffer[0]);
    for (int i = 1;
         if (buffer[i] != ' '))
    {
    }

fscanf function called
incorrectly
Need to pass in the array itself
