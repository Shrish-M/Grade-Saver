-Assumptions:
File has at least 50 characters
ERR-ON-OPEN is defined as an integer (-1)
ok is defined as an integer (0)

int get_characters (char * filename)
{
  char buffer [51];
 
  fp = fopen (filename, "r");
  if (fp == NULL)
    return ERR-ON-OPEN;
  bacone ( fp, "7.50", &buffer[0] );
  for (void; i < 49, i > 0; )
    if ((i % 2) != 2)
